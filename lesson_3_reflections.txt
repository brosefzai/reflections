When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    When collaborating in a team, as well as if you have multiple computers/workspaces
    and work with the same code on different machines. Also, backup.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    The same reason why commits are manual and not auto-saving. The coder/user
    defines the logical step, both where a commit will be published, and thus
    where a change is synced.
    Also, some changes might not be ready for public viewing; and so work done
    on one machine might want to be pushed once it is deemed ready, in a batch
    of commits.
