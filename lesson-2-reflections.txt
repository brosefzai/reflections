What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

		This is required for setting up git for a given directory. Individual files,
		however, haven't been tracked yet.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

		The 'staging area' is simply the intermediary step between commits; when
		files that are ready to be included in the repo are preliminarily added.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?

		You can compare the staging area with the working (current) directory (git
		diff), to ensure that the staging area (which have preliminary commits via
		git add) have the same changes as the files currently being worked on.
		You can compare the staging area with the last commit (git diff --staged)
		to check changes between the working commit (ie staging area), and last
		commit.
		The staging area can thus be verified on both ends to check if it holds
		a change that warrants a logical commit.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history
organized? How would branches help?

		When experimenting, creating alternative versions of a program (ie 
		translations), etc. Branching enables multiple versions of code to be
		worked on safely and cleanly.

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

the diagram the way we do?
